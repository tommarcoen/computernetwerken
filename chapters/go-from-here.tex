\chapter{Where to go from here?}
\label{chap:go-from-here}

Almost every chapter contains a section title \emph{Further reading} in which I provide a few books that you may consult for more in-depth knowledge on the subjects covered in that chapter.

In this appendex I want to provide a few personal comments on some of these books.
