        I have not yet read this book but the reviews look promising.
        A few quotes from the authors of the book:
        ``We are also humbled that many universities and colleges have selected the book as part of their curriculum for wireless technology classes.''
        and
        ``We discovered that a large number of people who purchase the book use it as a reference guide in the workplace and not just as a study guide.''

       This book goes into a lot of depth and probably is a bit too difficult for a beginner but it is a good resource after finishing your \abbr{CCNA} certification.
       I prefer the three volumes written by Stevens over those written by Comer, mostly because Stevens uses the Unix source code in his examples while Comer uses the source code from a completely unknown operating system.
