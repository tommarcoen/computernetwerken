        I am not a fan of Packt Publishing but when Chris Greer -- a leading expert on the topic -- recommends a book on Wireshark, it must be good.

        Comer is an internationally recognized authority on \acs{TCP}/\acs{IP} and internetworking.
        This book is part of a series containing three volumes.
        The other uses code exmamples from Xinu, an operating system which he wrote himself.
